/**
 * This service can be called to set the class loader on a thread.
 * The class loader will include classes which commonly are communicated between
 * two data analysis processes. For instance if workflows and the UI are 
 * communicating.
 * 
 * The class loader will include things like AbstractDataset and beans used
 * to commicate tool data.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * <code>
 * IClassLoaderService service = (IClassLoaderService)PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getService(IClassLoaderService.class);
 * 
 * try {
 *     service.setDataAnalysisClassLoaderActive(true);
 *     
 *     // Communicate
 *     
 * } finally {
 *     service.setDataAnalysisClassLoaderActive(false);
 * }
